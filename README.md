## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using deep learning techniques. Accurate churn predictions can help businesses identify at-risk customers and implement effective retention strategies.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. The following steps are performed:
- Removal of duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and insights. Key steps include:
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features that can improve model performance. Steps include:
- Interaction features
- Aggregation features
- Temporal features

## Modeling

Deep learning models are implemented and compared, including:
- Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (optional)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (optional)

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation is used to ensure robustness.

## Results

The results section highlights the performance of different models and identifies the best-performing model. Visualizations of model predictions and actual churn rates are included.

## Conclusions

This section summarizes the key findings, discusses the implications, and suggests potential improvements for future work.
